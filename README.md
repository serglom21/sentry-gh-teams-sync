- The token used to call the GH API can be a Fine-grained personal access token

- This is the endpoint that I used https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users/users?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-user

- In order for that endpoint to return the email of the user, the user needs to have their public email set under Settings -> Public Profile and it needs to match with the one in Sentry
